## Crafting recipes  

<br>

## Ammunition  
All ammunition can be crafted using the weapon assembly.  
To do so, the machine must be shift-right-clicked when setting the recipe.  
Note that none of the recipes use the "normal" gunpowder from minecraft.  
The recipes for ammunition is always as follows:  
 - as many iron nuggets as the weapon has bullets  
 - 2 iron ingots  
 - as many gun powder as half the amount of bullets  
 - as many primer powder as half the amount of bullets  

For the RPG:  
 - 2 iron ingots  
 - 9 gun powder
