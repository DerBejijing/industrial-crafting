## Chemicals  
This document lists all chemical crafting recipes.  
All recipes appear in this format:  

```
Machine:        condenser

Ingredients:    1x distilled water
catalysts:      1x sulfuric acid
outputs:        1x oxygen
                2x hydrogen

power required: 10
time required:  1

notes:          -
```
Ingredients are all items that will be consumed, while requiremends are items that act as a catalyst and will thus not be consumed.  
Under "notes" important things will be listed, like that if contaminated ingredients are used, the recipe might produce waste or detonate the machine.
