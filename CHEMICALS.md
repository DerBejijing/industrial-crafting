## Chemicals  
This document lists all chemical crafting recipes.  
All recipes appear in this format:  

```
Machine:        condenser

Ingredients:    1x distilled water
catalysts:      1x sulfuric acid
outputs:        1x oxygen
                2x hydrogen

power required: 10
time required:  1

notes:          -
```
Ingredients are all items that will be consumed, while requiremends are items that act as a catalyst and will thus not be consumed.  
Under "notes" important things will be listed, like that if contaminated ingredients are used, the recipe might produce waste or detonate the machine.

## Disclaimer  
I am once again required to remind you about the disclaimer:  
```
The synthesis-machanisms for some chemicals have been slightly simplified or modified for two reasons:

    some recipes would be extremely complicated
    some chemicals are controlled and restricted for obvious reasons and I legaly cannot provide detailed instructions on their manufacture

The synthesis mechanisms have been derived from public information. I do not provide any information that would not be available otherwise!
Do not attempt to reproduce any of the chemical recipes at home!
Not only are they extremely dangerous, but also restrited by the government!
