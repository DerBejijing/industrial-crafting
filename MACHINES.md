multiblock machines for minecraft

## Machines  
This document lists all machines, how they work and how they are built.  
All machines must be constructed using their base materials, and then be activated using the blueprint.  
To do so the bottom right block on the front must be right clicked.  

The instructions for construction are done using this layout:
