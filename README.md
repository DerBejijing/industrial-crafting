multiblock machines for minecraft

## About  
This is a minecraft plugin that adds multiblock machines and recipes to produce various chemicals and weapons for a certain datapack.  

<br>

## Disclaimer  
The synthesis-machanisms for some chemicals have been slightly simplified or modified for two reasons:  
- some recipes would be extremely complicated  
- some chemicals are controlled and restricted for obvious reasons and I legaly cannot provide detailed instructions on their manufacture  

The synthesis mechanisms have been derived from public information. I do not provide any information that would not be available otherwise!  
Do not attempt to reproduce any of the chemical recipes at home!  
Not only are they extremely dangerous, but also restrited by the government!  

<br>

## Usage  
All recipes and machines are obtained by first crafting a "blueprint" using one paper and one blue dye.  
The blueprint can be written using:  
`/setrecipe` : choose from a list of all available recipes  
`/setmachine`: choose from a list of all available machines

## About machines  
To build a machine, one must first lay out their structure using their base materials: smooth stone, chests, dispensers...  
More on that in the section "added machines".  
After building the structure, the bottom right block of the structure must be clicked with the blueprint for this machine.  
If all blocks match the requirements, the machine will be constructed and is now ready to use.  

Most machines have the following interfaces with each a different purpose:  
| Interface name | description |  
| --- | --- |  
| Generator | Some recipes require different amounts of energy. Fuel must be placed in here. |  
| Input | The input hatch is used to supply the machine with materials. |  
| Output | All crafted items, as well as chemical waste appear here. |  
| Interface | This is used to get an overview of the current job, the power level and is used to power on the machine. |  

Before a machine can be used to manufacture anything, a recipe must be set.  
To do so, the bottom right block of the machine must be clicked with a blueprint containing the recipe.  
Note, that not all recipes work on all machines!

## Added machines  
The following machines have been added.  
Click on any of them to get detailed instructions.  
| Machine | description |  
| --- | --- |  
| Chemical refinery | Used to convert normal minecraft items to usable chemicals. |
| Recrystallizer | Used to purify some cristalline chemicals like sulfur.Â |
| Macerator | Crush blocks to powder. |
| Condenser | Separate solids from fluids and distill fluid mixtures. |
| Macerator | Crush blocks into powder. |
| Centrifuge | Separate powders. |
| Electrolyser | Separate molecules through electrolysis. |
| Solar Electrolyser | The same as the normal electrolyser, but powered by the sun. |
| Furnace | Burn materials. |

## About chemicals  
This plugin adds many new chemicals, some with certain abilities.  
Every chemical has a certain purity assigned.  

Unpure chemicals have the following undesirable side effects:  
- the crafted material will (usually) also be contaminated  
- in a final crafting stage, the recipe has an increased chance of producing junk  
- if throwable explosives like TATP are contaminated, there is an increasing chance of spontaneous decomposition upon throwing  

These are the purity rates, ranked from worst to best:  
- Heavy contaminations  
- Contaminated  
- Low contaminations  
- Considered clean  
- Commercial grade purity  
- Industrial grade purity
