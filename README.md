multiblock machines for minecraft

## About  
This is a minecraft plugin that adds multiblock machines and recipes to produce various chemicals and weapons for a certain datapack.  

<br>

## Disclaimer  
The synthesis-machanisms for some chemicals have been slightly simplified or modified for two reasons:  
- some recipes would be extremely complicated  
- some chemicals are controlled and restricted for obvious reasons and I legaly cannot provide detailed instructions on their manufacture  

The synthesis mechanisms have been derived from public information. I do not provide any information that would not be available otherwise!  
Do not attempt to reproduce any of the chemical recipes at home!  
Not only are they extremely dangerous, but also restrited by the government!  

<br>

## Usage  
All recipes and machines are obtained by first crafting a "blueprint" using one paper and one blue dye.  
The blueprint can be written using:  
`/setrecipe` : choose from a list of all available recipes  
`/setmachine`: choose from a list of all available machines

## About machines  
To build a machine, one must first lay out their structure using their base materials: smooth stone, chests, dispensers...  
More on that in the section "added machines".  
After building the structure, the bottom right block of the structure must be clicked with the blueprint for this machine.  
If all blocks match the requirements, the machine will be constructed and is now ready to use.  

Most machines have the following interfaces with each a different purpose:  
| Interface name | description |  
| --- | --- |  
| Generator | Some recipes require different amounts of energy. Fuel must be placed in here. |  
| Input | The input hatch is used to supply the machine with materials. |  
| Output | All crafted items, as well as chemical waste appear here. |  
| Interface | This is used to get an overview of the current job, the power level and is used to power on the machine. |  

Before a machine can be used to manufacture anything, a recipe must be set.  
To do so, the bottom right block of the machine must be clicked with a blueprint containing the recipe.  
Note, that not all recipes work on all machines!
